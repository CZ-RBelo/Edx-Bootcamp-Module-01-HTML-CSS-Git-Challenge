### Repository

This repository ("Edx-Bootcamp-Module-01-HTML-CSS-Git-Challenge") is part of the challenge proposed in Module 01 of the Bootcamp UK Web Front End Developer Course.
The project aims to rectify the code base of a marketing agency's website so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines (SEO).

### Description

The Horizon marketing agency website is divided into five elements:

**Header**
Includes a navigation bar with the brand name on the left and a link pointing to the Home Page, and on the right side are the Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing links pointing to the respective sections on the website.

**Navigation**
Right after the top bar, there is the "Digital Marketing Meeting" image, which occupies the entire navigation element.

**Section**
On the left side with four articles Search Engine Optimization, Online reputation management, and Social media marketing, with their descriptions and images, where each of the titles is the destination of the links from the Header.

**Aside**
On the right side with three sections, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness, and Cost Management, and their icons and descriptions.

**Footer**
The footer is where the copyright is found.
